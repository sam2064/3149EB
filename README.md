In the first stage of the competition, there were several tasks designed to help us learn about FPGA, Verilog and CPU architecture. We grasped technical concepts from the resources provided and used them to finish small tasks/assignments.Each task also came with its own problem to solve within a set timeframe.

## Stage 1 =>
## Task 0:
The task was broken down into various sub-tasks as followed:
1. Software Introduction & Installation
2. Testing Setup
3. Verilog Design Implementation
4. Basics of CPU Architecture
5. Attempt Quiz -After completing the previous sections of the task and reviewing additional resources, we were well prepared to create our own digital circuits and participate in the quiz. Each team member attempted the quiz individually, as the questions will varied for each person.

## Task 1:
### A : Frequency Scaling & PWM Generator
Problem Statement-
To scale down the frequency of 50MHz to 1MHz and 500Hz and implement Pulse Width Modulation on it.
### B : Color Detection using Frequency Detection
Problem Statement-
To detect red, green, and blue color by using the frequency generated by the respective colors. Write a code to interface color sensor TCS 3200 on simulation. Design a finite state machine and frequency detector for identifying the color.

### C: RISC-V CPU
Problem Statement-
To implement the RISC-V CPU in Verilog for rv32i ISA. Complete the RISC-V CPU from the given boiler plate CPU design. The boiler plate design is written for basic instructions and extend the design to implement other instructions.

## Task 2:
In Task 2, we dove headfirst into the fascinating world of UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication. We designed both the UART transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) modules entirely from scratch using Verilog.
### A : Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART)
  #### 1: UART Transmitter
  Problem Statement-
  Design the UART Transmitter (TX) with a parity bit. This UART Transmitter will use the parameters mentioned in Table 1.
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32ccfb11-682a-4d74-98b1-52b396b9dbbd)
  
  The UART transmitter takes a 1-bit input tx_start that initiates communication, a 1-bit input parity_type which determines the parity type (0 for even parity, 1 for odd parity), and an 8-bit input data that specifies the character to be transmitted. Based on the 8-bit data input, the module should output the tx signal as a UART data packet (serially) and assert the tx_done signal for one clock cycle to indicate that the UART data packet has been transmitted successfully. The module will have inputs and outputs as mentioned in Table 2.

  #### 2: UART Receiver
  Problem Statement-
  Designing UART Receiver (RX) with even parity. This UART Receiver will use the parameters in Table 1.
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf2ebb8d-8e38-48b6-8dba-90fcd0c27550)
  
  The UART receiver will receive the input UART data packet as described in Table 1. Based on the rx input signal, module should output rx_msg after receiving the entire UART data packet, rx_parity for error detection. The rx_complete signal should toggle for 1 clock cycle as well. This module will have inputs and outputs as mentioned in the following table.

### B : Path Planner on RISC-V CPU
Designing Path Planner that can be implemented on designed RISC-V CPU.
  #### 1: Path Planning Algorithm in C
  Problem Statement-
  Write an optimized path planning algorithm in the C program to compute a valid path between two points.You are supposed to implement a path planning logic in C that finds valid (necessary) and/or shortest (optional) path between two nodes. Start node and End node will be given as inputs to this C file, and your path planning module should output a path between these two nodes.

  #### 2: RISC-V CPU Execution
  Problem Statement-
  To execute the optimized Path Planner in C on the designed RISC-V CPU.At first the start and end points should be read from the data memory to compute a path and write the node points connecting the start and end point in the data memory after computation.

## Stage 2 =>
In this stage of the competition, teams are going to apply the knowledge gained so far in Verilog and FPGA into the actual hardware in a systematic way. This time you will be challenged with your creativity, problem solving and time-management skills.
### Hardware Testing
All teams were provided with the following set of components in their hardware kits

## Task 3:

### A : Arena Printing

### B : Bot building
Teams need to the design the robot using the components provided in the hardware kit. The robot dimensions should NOT exceed L = 12 cm, B = 12 cm and H = 20 cm. Apart from the color sensor and gripper assembly, NO other component should be outside a cube of the above dimensions.

### C : Pipelined RISC-V CPU
  Problem Statement-
  To implement pipelined RISC-V CPU by extending the implemented single-cycle cpu.Teams need to update the single-cycle RISC-V CPU from task 2B CPU design to implement pipelined RISC-V CPU.

## Task 4:
  In this task, EcoMender Bot (EB) built in the previous task should traverse around Fabrication Unit (FU) by following the black line along with node, color detection and wireless communication using Bluetooth Module.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a244204-6e05-48f9-8bfc-3129302af916)

  This task can be divided into 3 sub-tasks and then all the sub-tasks can be merged to complete the Task 4. The sub-tasks are as below:
1. Black Line Following
2. Color Detection
3. UART Transmission

##### Procedure
1. Place the EB in the Fabrication Unit (FU) as shown in the arena preparation image.
2. Power on the EB. EB should NOT start its traversal unless bluetooth module (HC-05) is connected with the Serial Bluetooth Terminal application.
3. During the traversal in the FU, EB should identify the Nodes and SI(sustainability levels- These are the color patches placed along the path close to a node in the different units indicating the sustainability level of the subunit) in the industry.
4. For indicating the sustainability level, the EB should glow detected color on one of the three LEDs for this task till it completes one lap. At the same time, EB should also send the Sustainability Level Message (SLM) as described in the RuleBook.
5. EB needs to complete Two laps/rounds from the start position within three minutes and reach the start point again (i.e., Node 10 or Node 11) in the last lap/round.
6. To indicate END of the run, EB should stop at the start point (Node 10 or Node 11) after two laps/rounds and then blink GREEN color light in all the three LEDs with 1 sec delay.
