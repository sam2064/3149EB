# Eyantra

In the first stage of the competition, there were several tasks designed to help us learn about FPGA, Verilog and CPU architecture. We grasped technical concepts from the resources provided and used them to finish small tasks/assignments.Each task also came with its own problem to solve within a set timeframe.

# Task 0:
The task was broken down into various sub-tasks as followed:
1.Software Introduction & Installation
2. Testing Setup
3. Verilog Design Implementation
4. Basics of CPU Architecture
5. Attempt Quiz -After completing the previous sections of the task and reviewing additional resources, we were well prepared to create our own digital circuits and participate in the quiz. Each team member attempted the quiz individually, as the questions will varied for each person.

# Task 1:
# A : Frequency Scaling & PWM Generator
Problem Statement-
To scale down the frequency of 50MHz to 1MHz and 500Hz and implement Pulse Width Modulation on it.
# B : Color Detection using Frequency Detection
Problem Statement-
To detect red, green, and blue color by using the frequency generated by the respective colors. Write a code to interface color sensor TCS 3200 on simulation. Design a finite state machine and frequency detector for identifying the color.

# C: RISC-V CPU
Problem Statement-
To implement the RISC-V CPU in Verilog for rv32i ISA. Complete the RISC-V CPU from the given boiler plate CPU design. The boiler plate design is written for basic instructions and extend the design to implement other instructions.

# Task 2:
In Task 2, we dove headfirst into the fascinating world of UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication. We designed both the UART transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) modules entirely from scratch using Verilog.
# A : Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART)
  # 1: UART Transmitter
  Problem Statement
  Design the UART Transmitter (TX) with a parity bit. This UART Transmitter will use the parameters mentioned in Table 1.

  The UART transmitter takes a 1-bit input tx_start that initiates communication, a 1-bit input parity_type which determines the parity type (0 for even parity, 1 for odd parity), and an 8-bit input data that specifies the character to be transmitted. Based on the 8-bit data input, the module should output the tx signal as a UART data packet (serially) and assert the tx_done signal for one clock cycle to indicate that the UART data packet has been transmitted successfully. The module will have inputs and outputs as mentioned in Table 2.

  # 2: UART Receiver
  Problem Statement
  Designing UART Receiver (RX) with even parity. This UART Receiver will use the parameters in Table 1.

  The UART receiver will receive the input UART data packet as described in Table 1. Based on the rx input signal, module should output rx_msg after receiving the entire UART data packet, rx_parity for error detection. The rx_complete signal should toggle for 1 clock cycle as well. This module will have inputs and outputs as mentioned in the following table.

# B : Path Planner on RISC-V CPU
Designing Path Planner that can be implemented on designed RISC-V CPU.
