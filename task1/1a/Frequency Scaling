Instructions
-------------------
Students are not allowed to make any changes in the Module declaration.
This file is used to design a module which will scale down the 50MHz Clock Frequency to 1MHz.

Recommended Quartus Version : 20.1
The submitted project file must be 20.1 compatible as the evaluation will be done on Quartus Prime Lite 20.1.

Warning: The error due to compatibility will not be entertained.
